1. DL1_Image_Generation.ipynb

Description:
This notebook demonstrates how to generate realistic images using deep learning models. It covers key steps like dataset loading, model architecture setup (such as GANs or diffusion models), and generating new images from trained models. Ideal for anyone exploring creative AI applications in art, design, or synthetic data generation.

Highlights:

Deep learningâ€“based image generation workflow

Model training and fine-tuning steps

Visualization of generated images

Practical, beginner-friendly explanations

2. DL2_NLP_Tokenization.ipynb

Description:
A hands-on notebook exploring the foundation of Natural Language Processing: tokenization. It explains how raw text is transformed into tokens using methods like word, sentence, and subword tokenization. The notebook includes examples with NLTK, spaCy, and Hugging Face tokenizers.

Highlights:

Tokenization techniques and their differences

Preprocessing steps for text data

Real examples with popular NLP libraries

Ready-to-run code for experimentation

3. Sentement_Analysis.ipynb

Data_Set_For_Sentiment_Analysis:===> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews?select=Reviews.csv

Description:
This project focuses on sentiment analysis, a key task in NLP that classifies text as positive, negative, or neutral. The notebook walks through data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation. It uses real text data and visualizations to show how sentiment models interpret language.

Highlights:

End-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline

Data preprocessing and feature extraction (TF-IDF, embeddings)

Model building with machine learning and deep learning methods

Performance metrics and visualization
